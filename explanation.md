# Breakdown:

---

Hereâ€™s a line-by-line explanation of the provided chess bot code from the chessbot_code.txt file:
```c
#include
#include
#include
```

These are preprocessor directives that include standard input/output, string handling, and general utility functions from the C standard library.
```c
#define SIZE 8
```

This defines a constant SIZE with a value of 8, representing the dimensions of the chess board (8x8).


```c
c int boardSIZE;
```

This declares a two-dimensional array board of integers to represent the chess board.

```c
int lastBotMoveX = -1; // Track last moved piece's coordinates for the bot
int lastBotMoveY = -1;
int botConsecutiveMoves = 0; // Track consecutive moves of the same piece
```
These variables are used to track the last move made by the bot and the number of consecutive moves made by the same piece.

## Function Definitions

```c
void initBoard() {
```
This function initializes the chess board with the starting positions of the pieces.

```c
for (int i = 0; i = 0) { // Check if it's empty or occupied by the opponent
    int score = pieceValue(boardnewX) - pieceValue(boardi);
If the target square is valid, it calculates a score based on the piece values.

if (newX  bestScore) {
    bestScore = score;
    bestFromX = i;
    bestFromY = j;
    bestToX = newX;
    bestToY = newY;
}
```
If the current move has a better score than previously found moves, it updates the best move variables.

```c
if (bestScore != -1) {
```
This checks if a valid move was found.

```c
if (lastBotMoveX == bestFromX && lastBotMoveY == bestFromY) {
    botConsecutiveMoves++;
    if (botConsecutiveMoves < 2) {
        printf("Bot moves from (%d, %d) to (%d, %d).\n", bestFromX + 1, bestFromY + 1, bestToX + 1, bestToY + 1);
        boardbestToX = boardbestFromX;
        boardbestFromX = 0;
        lastBotMoveX = bestFromX;
        lastBotMoveY = bestFromY;
    } else {
        printf("Bot cannot move the same piece more than twice in a row.\n");
    }
} else {
    botConsecutiveMoves = 0;
    printf("Bot moves from (%d, %d) to (%d, %d).\n", bestFromX + 1, bestFromY + 1, bestToX + 1, bestToY + 1);
    boardbestToX = boardbestFromX;
    boardbestFromX = 0;
    lastBotMoveX = bestFromX;
    lastBotMoveY = bestFromY;
}
```
This block executes the best move found, ensuring the same piece isn't moved consecutively more than twice.

```c
} else {
    printf("Bot has no valid moves.\n");
}
```
If no valid moves are found, it notifies that the bot cannot move.

## Check and Checkmate Functions

```c
int isAttacked(int x, int y, int opponent) {
```
This function checks if a square is attacked by an opponent's piece.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        if (boardi == opponent) {
            if (canMove(i, j, x, y)) {
                return 1; // The square is attacked
            }
        }
    }
}
return 0; // The square is not attacked
```
This nested loop checks all opponent pieces to see if any can move to the specified square.

```c
int isCheckmate(int player) {
```
This function checks if the specified player is in checkmate.

```c 
int kingX, kingY;
```
These variables will store the king's position.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        if (boardi == player) {
            kingX = i;
            kingY = j;
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
This loop finds the position of the player's king.

```c
if (!isAttacked(kingX, kingY, -player)) {
    return 0; // The king is not in check
}
```
It checks if the king is in check. If not, the function returns false (0).

```c
for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
        if (boardi == player) { // The player's piece
            for (int newX = 0; newX < SIZE; newX++) {
                for (int newY = 0; newY < SIZE; newY++) {
                    if (canMove(i, j, newX, newY)) {
                    ```
This nested loop checks all pieces of the player to see if any can make a valid move.

```c
int temp = boardnewX;
boardnewX = player; // Move the piece
boardi = 0; // Empty the original square
```
It simulates the move by temporarily moving the piece.

```c
if (!isAttacked(kingX, kingY, -player)) {
    // Undo the move
    boardi = player;
    boardnewX = temp;
    return 0; // There is a valid move to escape check
}
```
It checks if the king is still in check after the simulated move. If not, it undoes the move and returns false (0).

```c
return 1; // The king is in check and has no valid moves (checkmate)
```
If no valid moves are found, it returns true (1), indicating checkmate.

## Main Function

```c
int main() {
```
This is the entry point of the program.

```c
initBoard();
printf("Initial Board:\n");
displayBoard();
```
It initializes the board and displays the initial state.

```c
while (1) {
```
This starts an infinite loop for the game.

```c
char input[10];
printf("Enter move (fromX fromY toX toY) or 'end' to exit: ");
fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
```
It prompts the player to enter a move or to exit the game.

```c
if (strcmp(input, "end\n") == 0) {
    break;
}
If the player types "end", the loop breaks, ending the game.

int fromX, fromY, toX, toY;
sscanf(input, "%d %d %d %d", &fromX, &fromY, &toX, &toY);
```
It reads the player's move from the input.

```c
fromX -= 1;
fromY -= 1;
toX -= 1;
toY -= 1;
```
Adjusts the input for 0-indexed array access.

```c
if (canMove(fromX, fromY, toX, toY)) {
    boardtoX = boardfromX;
    boardfromX = 0;
    printf("Player moves from (%d, %d) to (%d, %d).\n", fromX + 1, fromY + 1, toX + 1, toY + 1);
} else {
    printf("Invalid move.\n");
    continue;
}
```
Validates the player's move and updates the board if valid; otherwise, it notifies the player of an invalid move.

```c
if (isCheckmate(6)) {
    printf("Checkmate! Black wins!\n");
    break;
}
```
Checks if the player (white) has won by checkmate.

```c
botMove();
```
Calls the bot's move function to let the bot make its move.

```c
if (isCheckmate(-6)) {
    printf("Checkmate! White wins!\n");
    break;
}
```
Checks if the bot (black) has won by checkmate.

```c
displayBoard();
```
Displays the current state of the board after each turn.

```c
return 0;
}
```
Ends the main function and returns 0, indicating successful execution.

This code implements a simple text-based chess game where a player can play against a bot, with basic move validation and check/checkmate detection.
